<h1><a href="">More About Me</a></h1>  
With over 25 years of work-experience in the USA and across the globe, I bring an unique perspective on global business, cultural expectations, and practices.  While I have largely focused on the Telecommunications and the Media & Entertainment industries I have also, within the USA, worked on projects related to Financial and Pharmaceutical companies.  
<p>
My views below reflect my experience and lessons learnt in my career thus far.
<p>
My areas of expertise include Customer Experience and Digital Transformation.  As Senior Vice President of a Media company, I set-up their Customer Experience, Digital Transformation, and Loyalty department and teams.  Execution of these functions and frameworks are solely driven by customer-centricity.  
<p>
Given the diversity of market segments that businesses pursue, the competitive landscape, and emerging technology trends compel businesses to reach out to customers via omni channels 24x7.   Unforgiving customers rightfully demand services anywhere, anytime, and via any channel.  
<p>
My experience in reaching out to customers via the Web, Mobile, TV, Print Media, Direct Mail, Call Centers, Retail channels, 3rd party Distribution channels, Direct Sales, etc. have made it very clear to me that customer-centricity is best guided by a Customer Bill of Rights.  The Bill of Rights will ensure that customers are always borne in mind when making business decisions.
<p>
Businesses need to understand a customer's journey and lifecycle so that they allocate appropriate resources and design experiences in the customer's journey and thereby deliver value to the customer.  The purpose of focusing on the customer's experience is to ensure the loyalty of the customer to the brand.   We must remember that competition is a mere proverbial click away!  
<p>
Given the multiple channels of interaction with the customer, the objective of Digital Transformation is to increase the percentage of customer interactions via Digital channels.  This percentage measure indicates the penetration of the digital channels for a business, and given the comparatively low unit-costs of interaction incurred by these channels, also the success of the business and its' agility in meeting customer expectations.   
<p>
None of the above means that a business must not focus on its' bottom-line profits!  Au contraire, the probability of a business' profits and longevity today may actually depend on the customer experiences delivered.   Technologies deployed to enhance customer experiences can often be leveraged to streamline business processes and reduce costs to serve customers.  
<p>
Transformation may therefore mean leveraging new digital technologies for (a) innovation to monetize new products and services targeting the customer, or (b) enhancement / modification of current products and services, or (c) streamlining of cost factors.
<p>
All of the above means that there are a whole sleuth of data to be reckoned with and analyzed to ensure that the right product or service is provided to the customer at the right time and in the right place via the right channel.  A lot of this has to be done in anticipation of customer behavior and therefore competency in predictive analytics is a necessary investment.   
<p>
Having been a key member on the Governance Board for Big Data for the Media company, I know that the challenges for setting up such an infrastructure is no mean task.  The good news though, is that businesses can start small being driven by priorites dictated by their business.  Clearly, the upside potential and rewards for these investments "are worth every penny invested".   Measured investment risk is inevitable in markets today, if businesses need to be transformed to meet customer expectations.  
<p>
Professionals today almost need to be entrepreneurial in managing their careers.  It is all about the customer and the ability to communicate value to them. It is also about the ability to cut through grime and slime to make things work, as best exemplified by many of the digital start-ups of the last two decades.     I have been fortunate enough to have been biten by the entrepreneurial bug twice when I ventured out to start new companies.   Unfortunately though, I did not succeed - and that may be a topic to discuss in my next blog.  Having said that, the lessons from these experiences have been humbling and invaluable in terms of being prepared for my next effort - whether as an individual or as an entrepreneurial contributor for my next employer.   It is further my belief that the Bootcamp offers me cutting-edge skills to create the kind of tools, channels, and media to deliver what the market is looking for. 
<p>
In meeting and executing on the above business expectations, one needs to be savvy about his or her professional, personal, and social experiences and outlook.  There are no excuses.
<p> 
On my part I look for role-models, like the 3 below from whom I draw inspiration.
